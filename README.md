## Python-Challenge
# Python Project for Rice University

In this homework project, I will be using previous learnt concepts to complete two python challenges, PyElections and PyFinances. Both of these challenges encompasses a real-world situation Python scripting skills can come in handy. 


# PyElections

In this challenge, I was tasked with helping the city of Houston modernize its vote-counting process for the next mayoral elections. No candidate won a majority (over 50%) of the vote during the general election that took place on November 5, 2019. The 2019 Houston mayoral election was decided by a runoff on December 14, 2019 to elect the Mayor of Space City. I was assigned to write a script that will decide the two candidates with the highest number of votes and advance to the runoff election.

I was given a set of the last general election data called houston_election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Candidate, County, and Voter ID. I was tasked to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. Print the names of the two candidates who will advance to the runoff election.

The final script printed both the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results. 


# PyFinances



In this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. I was given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Profit/Losses and Date. 

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
